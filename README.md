=============

Information Visualization of my own Nike Plus running data contrasted with weather and location data.

This project presents a graphical representation of runs that I went on between May 2012 and May 2014. Also shown is external data that could have possibly these runs.

The colored area graphs present weather data from Weather Underground (Humidity, Max, Min and Mean Temperature) of the city I was at that point in time. Each dot represents a run and where they are placed on the y-axis determine how far of a run it was. The running data was collected from Nike Plus. The color of the dot represents my average pace. Hover over the infographic for more information about the weather and location, and over the dots to see more information about a run.
